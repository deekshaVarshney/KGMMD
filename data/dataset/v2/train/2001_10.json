I\u2019ve stayed at five Hilton hotels during the recent period and this is the first that\u2019s implemented this. It\u2019s just silly and you don\u2019t earn Hilton points this way. The hotel room was well appointed with nice toiletries and a balcony. However there was a very strong smell of cigarette smoke throughout the stay. I think from the curtains (Room 247) The bar service was okay but odd that you had to go to the bar to order drinks when the government advice is strongly to provide table service. Food is not served until after 5pm. The spa was good but a surcharge of \u00a320pp I think is a bit extortionate. The gym was a good size and I had a great workout. The breakfast was very disorganised, you had to book so they know who is coming and at what time. When we arrived there were no clean tables and food etc everywhere. You are served a very nice tray of continental breakfast with pastry and fruit etc. Whilst this is great, looking around the restaurant I was horrified at how much of the food was left and not touched on people\u2019s tables. I really think people should choose what they want to reduce waste (and cost). It was truly shocking. The hotel has staff who I believe want to do a good job but the service always misses the mark. The staff are never attentive or proactive and always look stressed and exasperated. Last time the GM said to email in advance to ensure a better stay this time. I did this and I can assure you this step made no difference whatsoever. Hotel really needs to up its game. It\u2019s such a great building and setting. ",
