Our room was clean and comfortable with a private bathroom across the landing. There were views of nearby mountains and the local town only a 10 minute drive away. We dined at Chez Gerard which was recommended by Linda and Chris and lived up to expectations. Linda and Chris were very friendly and helpful.

Staff are attentive, but not smothering for such a small Inn. The green room is on the second floor and absolutely lovely. It is a little more spacious then the purple room, which was on the main floor next to the pub. We thought that it might be a bit noisy, but were pleasantly surprised that we didn't hear a peep from the pub over the weekend (it also closes at 1am so that's not too bad). Regardless, the pub is amazing! Even if we had heard some noise, it would have been worth it to be next to such a great place for cocktails! They are offering a local charcuterie board at the pub from 5-7pm throughout the summer, and it is amazing! Fresh croissants delivered to your room each morning too. Would definitely recommend to people looking to enjoy Dawson City as a truly relaxing (and romantic) vacation!",
